                In this hard time of the pandemic, many people have lost their loving ones, And many people are ready to donate their medicine(After Recovery), Blood, Plasma but are unable to find a proper channel to do so. 
                Our idea revolves around solving this we Fethes and store data of both willing donors and needy ones Then Using automation a link of our chat Application is sent to all of them. Our Community will  Create a bridge for donors and the people who are in dire need.

How it Works?
                Web Scraping is used to collect data of both the willing donors and the people in need.
                Using Automation, an automated message is sent to all the users, containing the link of our Chat Application.
                Using our Chat application, people can communicate with each other in real-time. Their essential data is also stored securely.
                Finally, our CoviCure Website displays the data of all the donors. It also addresses Supply Chain Optimisation and Resource Management Services such as Nearby Oxygen Refill Centres and Hospital Beds availability.
